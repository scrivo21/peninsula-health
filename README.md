## 📈 Optimization Algorithm

### Penalty Point System
The scheduling algorithm uses a sophisticated penalty point system to ensure fair distribution:

- **Leadership Roles (+3 points)**: Blue and Green shifts requiring additional responsibility
- **Rosebud Location (+1 point)**: Accounts for increased travel distance  
- **PM Shifts (+1 point)**: Evening shifts generally less preferred
- **Fairness Balancing**: Post-processing swaps to minimize penalty point variance

### Features
- **Smart Assignment**: Prioritizes doctors with fewer penalty points accumulated
- **Experience Matching**: Considers senior/junior levels for appropriate shift assignment
- **Real-time Balancing**: Continuous optimization during roster generation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of schedule conflicts and constraints

## 📋 Export Formats
